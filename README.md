# HackGoWhere
Team Super Idol 的笑容都没你的甜<br>
Members: Leon, Wen Quan, Jia Le<br>
A 1.5 day team hackathon by Hack&Roll to create any project we want. Our team decided on creating an android app using our knowledge of Java.<br>
More details about Hack&Roll's hackathon could be found [here](https://hacknroll.nushackers.org/). <br>
Developed using Andriod SDK and FireBase <br>

# Motivation
Computing events such as hackathons and capture the flag are usually posted on the organizer's website or sent via students through student email or social media channels. This give rise to the problem of potential participants missing out of the event if they do not visit the websites or check their emails and social medias.Therefore, our application addresses this problem by collating all available events which are posted by the organizers, and users will be able to use the application to check for any events they might be interested in.

# Objectives
The objective of HackGoWhere is to provide a centralized platform for users to look for computing events they might be interested in, and not missed out on any potential events that might be keen on because they did not came across it.

# Aim
We hope to build a mobile application that brings organisers to one platform for publicising their events, making information more accessible.

# Features
Feature | Description
------------ | -------------
-Computing event listings (feed) | Overview of all current events that students can sign up for
-One click apply for events | Simple sign up process for students to apply for hackathons wit their pre-filled info 
-Personal profile where users can upload their credientials | Store data of frequently required information to qualify for hackathons
-History of computing events attended | Summary of past events so that it is simple for students to know what they have achieved
-Simple posting of events for organisers | Hassle free to use this platform for publicising their event.

# Improvements
Due to time limit, we are able to set up the front end and back end database with the abovementioned core features. Given more time, additions such as collating individuals' details into a JSON file for the organiser if he or she signed up for an event.

# Tech Stack
Front-End: Android SDK (Java)
Back-End: Firebase
