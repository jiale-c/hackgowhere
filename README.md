HackGoWhere

**Motivation**
Computing events such as hackathons and capture the flag are usually posted on the organizer's website or sent via students through student email or social media channels. This give rise to the problem of potential participants missing out of the event if they do not visit the websites or check their emails and social medias. Therefore, our application addresses this problem by collating all available events which are posted by the organizers, and users will be able to use the application to check for any events they might be interested in.

**Objectives**
The objective of HackGoWhere is to provide a centralized platform for users to look for computing events they might be interested in, and not missed out on any potential events that might be keen on because they did not came across it.


**Features**
-Computing event listings/ feed
-One click apply for events
-Personal profile where users can upload their credientials
-History of computing events attended


**Tech Stack**
