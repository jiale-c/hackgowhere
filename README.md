# Introduction

## About Us

We are both undergraduates from the School of Computing, majoring in Computer Science. We have decided to make an android mobile application for CP2106, which focuses on skills sharing between people. Neither of us have any prior experience in application development and have taken the opportunity of taking CP2106 to widen our exposure in this area. The initial level of difficulty chosen for this project is Gemini, but we have upgraded it to Apollo.

Our advisor for this project is Augustine Kau Zhi Cong, and we would like to thank him for his guidance throughout the process on this project.

## About Our Application

Our application is called GrabTutor. GrabTutor is an online skills sharing platform where people are able to search for a specific skill to learn through the listings posted by people who have the respective skill to teach them. Our application boasts a purple and white color theme, and also includes core features and design such as a user feed to view listings, search for specific listings, general chatting features and user profile customisation. GrabTutor is an android mobile application developed using Android Studio.

## Differentiating GrabTutor from similar platforms

GrabTutor positions itself as the &quot;Carousell&quot; for skills sharing and learning - anyone who possesses the relevant skills should be able to teach others, while anyone who is interested to learn should be able to do so at an affordable price. Compared to other conventional skills sharing platforms such as Udemy and Skillshare, users are able to learn or share various types of skills - not limited to only professional ones, but also recreational types.

Furthermore, most of such platforms require users to sign up either as a learner or tutor - but not both. At GrabTutor, we believe learning and teaching is for everyone. Hence, users are not limited to only teaching others, but can also sign up for lessons from others.

Finally, we believe there is a lack of similar platforms in the local market. Many skills sharing platforms are based in Western countries, which means they are unable to cater to local preferences, arrange for physical meet-ups, etc.

# Motivation

When individuals are looking to pick up or upgrade a skill set, it may be difficult for them to do so due to the high costs and long duration involved in physical courses, or the lack of interaction and opportunity to clarify doubts in self-taught online courses. On the other hand, individuals with specialized skills may be looking for ways to earn side income by teaching others their area of expertise, but lack the means to look for interested parties. Therefore, there is a need for a platform to connect people with specialised skills with those who are looking to learn a new skill. The platform will allow trainers to arrange classes with a flexible timetable to fit into a learner&#39;s schedule, and allow them to interact and answer queries at the same time.

# Aim

We hope to create a platform to connect individuals who may be seeking a trainer or skilled specialist to learn a new skill with those who are keen in showcasing and sharing theirs.

# User Stories

As a learner, I want to be able to connect with a trainer who is an expert in a particular skill set or language I am keen to learn, so that they can answer my queries or arrange classes.

As a learner, I want to be able to pick up a new skill from a trainer to improve my employability, without having to spend a huge sum on courses.

As a trainer, I want to be able to empower others who wish to learn with my knowledge, while earning a small side income at the same time.

As an administrator, I want to be able to identify abusers or scammers, so that I can warn and ban such users from the platform, in order to prevent abuse of the platform.

# Features and limitations

For the payment feature, we have implemented a simplified form of payment in the form of a bank wire transfer or crypto transfer with instructions. Initially we have wanted to implement a payway gateway such as visa or mastercard, but have found it too advanced for our level to be implemented.

For the homepage layout, our original intent was to implement it in such a way that the user&#39;s homepage is customised, consisting of featured (sponsored), recently viewed and recommended posts (based on history). However, we found the implementation of all three features simultaneously to be too advanced for our level. Hence, we decided to retain our original layout and improve its design/UI instead.

# Final Thoughts

## Improvements to Code

- Standardise naming conventions of variables
- Standardise naming conventions of classes
- Standardise usage of implementations

Eg. using switch cases for each button instead of coding them individually

## Further improvements

If we had more time for this project, we would like to implement the following:

- Allowing users to add other users as friends
- Allowing users to follow other users, much akin to instagram

# Responses to Feedbacks

Listed below are some of the feedback and bugs we received from our previous milestones which we have implemented or fixed:

1. Auto skip onboarding screen if it is not the user&#39;s first time launching the app
2. Hide &#39;GrabTutor&#39; header on the homepage
3. Users can directly chat with owner of a post from Categories
4. Clicking back when creating a post halfway crashes the app
5. Page to fill in title and description: Header covers part of the image
6. Route user to the page of the category user created instead of the home page
7. Ability to delete or edit posts
8. Ability to delete or edit reviews
